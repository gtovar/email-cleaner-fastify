# Contribution Guide — Email Cleaner & Smart Notifications

Thank you for contributing to this project.
This guide ensures consistency, code quality, and efficient collaboration.

---

## Project Structure

* `src/` — Fastify backend source code  
* `docs/` — Technical documentation and tutorials  
* `ops/` — Infrastructure and CI/CD scripts  
* `tests/` — Unit and integration tests  

---

## Workflow

1. **Create a descriptive branch from `develop`**
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feat/hu17-unify-suggestions-summary
   ```

2. **Follow Conventional Commits**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add email classification endpoint"
   git commit -m "fix: correct token validation error"
   ```

3. **Run tests before pushing**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Clearly describe what changed and why.  
   - Include screenshots or logs if applicable.  
   - Reference related issues.  

---

## Code Conventions

- Use **English names** for functions and variables (`EmailService`, `RuleController`).  
- Maintain consistent style via **Prettier + ESLint**.  
- Avoid logic duplication (“Don’t Repeat Yourself”).  
- Document public methods using **JSDoc**.  
- Maintain **≥ 80% test coverage** per PR.  

---

## Testing

**Backend (Fastify):**
```bash
npm run test:unit
npm run test:integration
```

**ML Microservice (Python):**
```bash
pytest -v
```

Every PR must include at least one relevant unit or integration test.

## Branching & Versioning Standards

| Type          | Prefix      | Example                   |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
| New feature   | `feat/`     | feat/hu17-unify-suggestions-summary |
| Bug fix       | `fix/`      | fix/huNN-short-desc |
| Documentation | `docs/`     | docs/huNN-short-desc |
| Refactor      | `refactor/` | refactor/huNN-short-desc |
| Maintenance   | `chore/`    | chore/update-dependencies  |

Working branch: `develop` (feature branches start and merge here).  
Stable branch: `main` (updated from `develop` at releases/checkpoints).  
Canonical HU naming: `type/huNN-short-desc` (lowercase `hu` id).

**Versioning:** Semantic Versioning (SemVer)  
Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` → Example: `1.4.2`

---

## Commit Guidelines (Conventional Commits)

```bash
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
# Valid types: feat | fix | docs | style | refactor | test | chore
```

Example:
```bash
feat(auth): implement Gmail refresh token logic
```
